# Reporting Issues

Before reporting an issue with GitHub, be sure that:

- you are running the latest version of Snake
- you are using a clean installation
- the issue has not already reported

Snake is made of multiple components and as such issues pertaining to one should be reported in the appropriate repository.
If the issue is more general, or a query then reporting the issue under the Snake repository is more than adequate.
When filing a bug report please provide as much information as possible.

# Contributing

## Getting Started

- Fork from the repository that you are going to contribute to
- Create a branch to avoid working directly on master
- Adhere to the style guidelines
- Commit in a reasonable fashion ideally like so: [writing-a-good-commit-message](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/master/README#L92)
- Submit a Pull Request (PR)

## Style Guidelines

- All:
  - Remove any trailing whitespace.
  - Match the tab width and indentation style.

- Python Based: Use `flake8` and `pylint` to ensure that Snake's python code is of an acceptable quality.

- Vue Based: The built-in linter for Vue is sufficient.
